\chapter{Conclusion and Discussion}
Through the project, we have reviewed our knowledge on probability and statistics, particularly ANOVA and Linear Regression. Also, we have an opportunity to enhance our practice skills with R language. We did not work much on GPU data. The major reason is that many features are not familiar to our studying fields but relevant to computer graphics. There may be many insights can be dug out, which are our intention in the future.
