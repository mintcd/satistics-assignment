\chapter{Introduction}

Phenomena that are meaningful to humans appear not to be stochastic. In the same sense, datasets produced by humans, or nature in time circulations have insights to be analyzed, which is accounted by Statistics. Thanks to Dr. Nguyen Thi Mong Ngoc's supervision in Probability and Statistics course, we have a chance to study basic statistics within an assignment with a tiny dataset. We organized our report in the following structure

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Overview of the dataset. In this chapter, we carefully describe in details as much as possible the dataset, specifically the properties of each instance. We also notice which features to be used for later statistical tasks.
  \item Preprocessing. We process data cleaning and some computations.
  \item Descriptive statistics. We calculate some qualitative features of the dataset.
  \item Inferential statistics. Our problems are explicitly stated and solved.
\end{enumerate}
