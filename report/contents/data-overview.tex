\chapter{Overview of the Dataset}

As Computer Science students, we are assigned to analyze a \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iliassekkaf/computerparts/data}{dataset about computer processors}, namely CPUs and GPUs. Our dataset is credited to Intel, Game-Debate, and the companies involved in producing the part. Information of CPUs and GPUs are collected separately into two files, namely \texttt{Intel\_CPUs.csv} and \texttt{All\_GPUs.csv}.
